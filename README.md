## James Barry 

Hi!  I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, College park, majoring in computer sciene and mathematics. Go Terps!

I am on GitHub to organise my code, find inspiration, and eventually build my career.

I am very interested in topics such as quantum computing and computing theory, and enjoy working and collaborating on personal coding projects.

I am always looking for oppurtunities!
